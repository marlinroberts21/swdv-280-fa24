    <p>When most places said that they wouldnt be able to fix my car after I got t-bones Scotts repair was the only place to take my car in.
    They showed me the price for all the parts after inspection and showed me their fee for working on the car. They got it done
        quick and had me back to driving my car within a few weeks.

    <p>After having years of sun damage on my F-150s paint I decided to get it fixed up. When I came to Scotts AutoBody I ended up getting a lot of information
    on the diffrent ways I could go about fixing my paint wether it was a wrap or a paint touchup. I decided to go with just a normal paint touchup and
        the car came out looking brand new again. Would reccomend everyone comes here.

    <p>They were able to get my perfect custom wrap for cheaper than most shops in the area were going to charge me.</p>
